![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/gleesik/the-c-programming-language-2nd-edition-solutions/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)

## Introduction
**The C Programming Language** is one of the most popular book about C written by *Brian W. Kernighan* and *Dennis M. Ritchie*.

Also referred just as **K&R**, the authors did a very good job at explaining the core concepts of programming.

Each chapter of the book contains **exercises** that are helpful for a better understanding of the language and test the progresses made throughout them.

This repository contains all the **solutions** to the exercises. They may not be the most optimal, but are a good start for people who are going through the same route.

## Environment
The source code is not tied up to an IDE, so any text editor will do the job. However, there are useful tasks and settings available for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). For a **better experience** using this editor, the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) provides some very helpful features specific to the C programming language.

### Compilers
To be able to write programs in C, a compiler is required. There are many options available for each operating system.

#### macOS
[**Clang**](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)

#### Linux
[**GCC**](https://gcc.gnu.org)

#### Windows
[**Windows Subsystem for Linux**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl) (a.k.a. WSL).

[**MinGW Compiler Collection**](http://www.mingw.org)

### Debuggers
[**LLDB**](https://lldb.llvm.org) for C, Objective-C and C++.

[**GDB**](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb) supports the following languages: Ada, Assembly, C, C++, D, Fortran, Go, Objective-C, OpenCL, Modula-2, Pascal, Rust.
